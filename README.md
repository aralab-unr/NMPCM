# NMPCM : Nonlinear Model Predictive Control on Resource-Constrained Microcontrollers
We are considering the NMPC with the following formulation:

To approximate the nonlinear dynamical function, we use its Jacobian at each time step:

where:

Thus, the linearized model can be rewritten as:

which simplifies to:

Hence, the nonlinear dynamical model can be approximated at each time step by:

Then the NMPC becomes the QP problem as:

Then, in order to solve the NMPC, we used the RK4 integration method and the qpOASES solver to solve the QP problem. Utilizing the code generation of ACADO and the qpOASES library, the generated code was then embedded into the microcontroller to solve the NMPC in real time.


# Code Generation
The code generation is based on ACADO code generation and the qpOASES solver; therefore, the following libraries are required:
- ACADO Toolkit (https://acado.github.io/)
- qpOASES (https://github.com/coin-or/qpOASES)

In order to generate the code of the NMPCM, follow these commands:
```shell
# Step 1: Clone the repository and download the ACADO code generation folder
$ Download the acadogenquad folder from the main branch.

# Step 2: Navigate to the ACADO workspace and generate the code
$ cd acadogenquad/build
$ cmake ..
$ make

# Step 3: Run the code generation
$ cd ./acadogenquad
```
Now, the generated code is located in the acadogen_quad folder, which includes the necessary include directory required to run NMPCM. For more details on code generation, the author strongly recommends visiting: [ACADO Getting Started Guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/kinetic/api/acado/html/sim_getting_started.html)

# Simulations
## Software Requirements & Setup

The simulation is configured with the following setup:
- Ubuntu 22.04
- ROS2 Humble
- Gazebo 11
- Xarco-ROS-Humble (sudo apt install ros-humble-xacro)
- Gazebo_ros_pkgs (sudo apt install ros-humble-gazebo-ros-pkgs)
- ACADO Toolkit (https://acado.github.io/)


Follow these commands in order to install the simulation of NMPC-PID on ROS 2:

```shell
# Step 1: Create and build a colcon workspace:
$ mkdir -p ~/dev_ws/src
$ cd ~/dev_ws/
$ colcon build
$ echo "source ~/dev_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc

# Step 2: Clone this repo into your workspace
$ cd ~/dev_ws/src
Download the folder nmpcpidquad in the main branch

# Step 3: Build the colcon workspace for this package
$ cd ~/dev_ws
$ colcon build
```
